# LetsTalk Code Challenge
 
This is a simple challenge where you can show all your skills. There are no rules, it's absolute open to however you want to solve it. 

We also want to understand how talented are you figuring out the best possible solutions for a single problem.

##Â Schedule challenge

Index.html is a simple calendar structure (like Google Calendar) with no events rendered.

Given /js/data.json, which is already requested via AJAX in /js/app.js, render items on the corresponding day, in a way that overlapping events are re-arranged in columns.

An expected output can be found in /img/expected.png.

## Important

- index.html and app.js files are just a hint on how you can get the data and show it.
- You can change it and use whatever method you want

## How to run

- You can upload the index.html to any server: apache, python or even install and use webpack dev server

## Tips
The key is not on the CSS. Each event can be an absolute positioned div.
